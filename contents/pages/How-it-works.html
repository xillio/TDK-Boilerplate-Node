<h1>How It Works</h1>

<h2>GETTING STARTED WITH HELLOTRANSLATE IS EASY AS 1–2–3!</h2>

<p>Today's modern headless websites are hardly ever built with a single CMS. More often than not, your digital presence
    is a combination of at least 3 different systems. Integrating those into a Translation Management System can be a
    real crime.</p>

<p>Using HelloTranslate you can integrate your content with your favorite technology and build a web service capable
    of</p>

<ul>
    <li>delivering the metadata of your content</li>
    <li>navigating your content repository</li>
    <li>downloading your content</li>
    <li>uploading translations</li>
</ul>

<p>Your web service needs to expose only one endpoint and HelloTranslate will send JSON RPC requests to specify the
    operation to perform and its parameters. Your web service will respond with a JSON RPC response describing the
    metadata of the content, delivering the binary content or simply confirm the translation creation.</p>

<p>If your system has normal API's, integrating your stack into our TDK will take you 2-3 days of development compared
    to the 60-100 days of development needed from your localization provider.</p>
