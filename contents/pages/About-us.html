<h1>HelloTranslate is the next innovation of Xillio Labs.</h1>

<h2>HelloTranslate is essentially the combination of 3 award-winning Xillio Labs innovations plus the Translation Development Kit (TDK) – it's icing on the cake!</h2>

<p>Our background story is really simple.</p>

<p>The HelloTranslate Marketplace concept and the focus on ease of use came from own experience. The team at Xillio
    wanted more leads. So, we looked at our leads and 97% came from US, Canada, Australia, UK and Netherlands. Guess
    what? Xillio.com is only in Dutch and English.</p>

<p>We wanted to test our hypothesis that if we translated into German and French we would significantly increase leads
    from those countries. We called a few translation companies, but we got nowhere. We got many lessons on why human
    translation is better, but no solution for our problem. We wanted it fast, cheap, easy and we wanted to try it out
    first with Machine Translation (MT). We then tried to get a translation solution for our Hubspot website on the
    Hubspot marketplace, but were first forced to buy a very expensive Translation Management System before we would get
    anywhere.</p>

<p>We saw the gap in the market.</p>

<p>A translation solution for BUSINESS minded IT and Marketing people that is very easy to use – allowing you to start
    the globalization journey with little effort and help you to grow in that journey.</p>
